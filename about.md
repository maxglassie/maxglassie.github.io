I'm a Georgetown graduate and Chinafile who fell in love with programming after reading The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. I graduated from the Turing School of Software and Design's backend engineering program in June 2017. This is my website where I explore the things that interest me: programming, philosophy, and Chinese language.
