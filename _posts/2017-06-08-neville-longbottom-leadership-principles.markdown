My final module at [Turing](https://www.turing.io/), I led a "posse", which is essentially a student club, called Armstrong. The previous leaders were focused on blockchain technologies. I'm very interested in blockchain technologies and volunteered to take over the group.

I believe in moving from capacity, meaning what I am capable of doing, rather than getting caught up in visions of grandeur. In this vein, I had to accept that I didn't know as much technically as the previous leadership. In fact, I didn't know much about blockchain at all.

Admitting my ignorance, the first thing I said is that we're all in this together in our desire to learn as a research team. My goal as the leader was simply to set a tone and to create a space for my fellow students to encounter the ideas and learn together.

Basically, if you know more or find a cool resource, it is your responsibility as a member of the team to share that knowledge with the group.

I said from the first meeting that my priority was to give away leadership. The best strategy that I know for doing this is what I call the Neville Longbottom principle of leadership development.

It goes like this:

**"I don't know who among you will be a hero and end up cutting off snakes heads and other badassery. What I do know is that it is most likely not who I expect it to be.**

**So the question is how do we create a space where people have the opportunity and the encouragement to grow and contribute? My priority as a leader is to create that space where these people potentialities can become real."**

The most concrete, measurable way of doing this is giving away the meeting time. By the end of the module, over our four Spike sessions, 4 people gave lightning talks, 2 people led technical tutorials, and we brought in a guest speaker to talk about application design.
