When Courtney and I were putting together our spike sessions (hour+ learning sessions for our fellow students) she playfully accused me of writing clickbait for our descriptions.

I didn't disagree. I wanted people to show up. In the course of my time at Turing, collaborating with Courtney and others, I wrote eight session descriptions and had a collective attendance of about 100 people. (Meaning, the attendance for each session added up, not unique people).

But I really believe in clickbait that has integrity. If I make a promise in my description, I am committed to delivering on that promise.

Here are some:

## Armstrong

First session:

_Why Blockchain Will Change the World (Or Won’t)

There’s a lot of hype going around about blockchain, with everyone from Fortune 100 companies to anarchists proclaiming the revolutionary power. From cryptocurrencies to uncorruptable voting systems, blockchain is going to solve all our problems, right?

Right. But what is the blockchain? In this first meeting of Armstrong we’ll look at all the revolutionary potential. And we’ll cut through the hype and give a simple definition anyone can take to a happy hour.

Join us to brainstorm what we want to accomplish as a research team this module; the questions we want to explore and what we’d like to build. All are welcome!_

Second session:
```
Getting Dirty with Blockchain Development

The Ethereum blockchain has a superpower - it allows us to code the blockchain using a language called Solidity. In this Armstrong led spike, we’re going to introduce Ethereum and Solidity and get messy with setting up our environment, writing a simple script, and diving into an application.

You’re not an expert and we aren’t either. Join our team as we move together from what we know to exploring what, as Dumbledore would say, are the thickets of wildest guesswork. It’s adventure time and everyone is welcome.
