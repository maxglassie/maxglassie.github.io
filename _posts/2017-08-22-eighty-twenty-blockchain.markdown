WTF is blockchain? Why are so many people talking about it?

There's so much hype going around, it's hard to cut through the noise and figure out what really matters here. While I'm no expert, I've been researching this technology with the goal of distilling the key concepts to take to a cocktail party or a happy hour. What do I need to know to engage in the conversation?

Before diving in, it's worthwhile to know that blockchain is the Wild West at the moment. Things are moving fast, there is a lot of uncertainty, and it's very difficult to say anything definitive about where this technology is heading.

1) Consensus
2) Distributed
3) Trustless
